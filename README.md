# Landing Page Project - The Odin Project

This project is part of The Odin Project's **Foundations** curriculum. The main objective was to recreate a landing page design using HTML and CSS, focusing heavily on Flexbox for layout and positioning.

## Project Description

The goal of this assignment is to build a modern-looking landing page based on a provided design guideline. It involves structuring the page with semantic HTML and styling it to match the visual reference. This project tests understanding of standard CSS properties, the box model, and especially Flexbox containers.

## Features

- **Hero Section**: Includes a logo, navigation links, main hero text, subtext, and a "Sign Up" call-to-action button, along with a placeholder image.
- **Information Section**: Displays four distinct information cards with placeholders for images and descriptive subtext.
- **Quote Section**: Features a styled motivational quote and author attribution.
- **Call to Action**: A final prompt section enticing the user to sign up.
- **Footer**: Simple copyright information.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For semantic structure (header, nav, main, footer, etc.)
- **CSS3**: For all styling, including:
  - **Flexbox**: Used extensively for aligning items in the header, hero, information cards, and CTA sections.
  - **Custom Fonts**: Integrated Google Fonts (Roboto).
  - **Variables**: (Implicitly used through consistent color codes #1F2937, #3882F6, etc.)

## Learning Outcomes

- Structuring a web page with semantic HTML tags.
- Applying CSS resets for consistent styling across browsers.
- Using `display: flex` to manage complex layouts (alignment, spacing, and ordering).
